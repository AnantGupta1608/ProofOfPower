# ⚡ ProofOfPower 🔥

**ProofOfPower** is an innovative smart contract built for the [CoreDAO](https://coredao.org/) blockchain. It tracks and rewards users based on how gas-efficient they are in their interactions. This gamifies gas optimization and encourages sustainable dApp usage.

---

## 🚀 Overview

> "In a world driven by power, be the one who saves it."

`ProofOfPower` monitors users’ interactions and logs their gas usage. It then calculates their average gas consumption and rewards the most efficient users. This concept brings a **green incentive layer** to CoreDAO by encouraging smart, minimal-cost blockchain interactions.
